          <i>"Tell me about yourself. What defines you?"</i><br><br>
          I try my very best to appreciate the little things in life. Backpacking in the mountains is one of my favorite activities because it is a time to appreciate existence, without worrying too much about anything other than getting from A to B.<br><br>I admire disciplined people and I think pushing myself is important. It is hard to accomplish much without setting and following goals that get me out of my comfort zone. Good things take time and conscious, constructive effort.<br><br>I like running and swimming because both great opportunities to push myself. And, exercise leads to feeling good.<br><br>I think it is important to give back whenever possible. You can have a bigger impact working for others than you can doing things for yourself. Teach, help, provide feedback, support.<br><br>I am a bit tired of moving. I haven't really settled down anywhere since I graduated from high school. Between school, internships, and vacations, I have lived in the Bay Area, Boston, China, San Diego, London, Bulgaria, and Seattle. Though I love traveling and seeing the world, I am looking forward to having a homebase for a little bit longer soon.<br><br>In college, I started programming. I love programming because it tends to objective and I find objectivity pleasings. Code either runs or it doesn't. You can time it and test it and sometimes prove its correctness. But programming is also an art. Where can you cache? How do you handle the edge cases? Is your code modular? Is it elegant? Is it fast?<br><br>I have amazing friends all over the world. I am most proud of my friends. I try to be really open and honest with everyone that I meet.
